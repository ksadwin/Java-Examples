About Minesweeper

The game is played by running the Minefield class and incorporates the Cell class, as well as StdIn and StdDraw functionality. Instructions for gameplay are printed in the opening menu screen.

BONUS IMPLEMENTATIONS:
*A game can be custom-constructed at any size between 9x9 and 30x20, with preset options at the Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert levels.
*Not suggested, but expanded the functionality of the first click to place no bombs in the clicked Cell OR any of its surrounding Cells, so that the player starts with a sizeable number of Cells revealed after the first click.
